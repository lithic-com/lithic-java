     *   transactions.
     * - `CARD_COMPROMISED`: Card compromised fraud occurs when a fraudster gains access to card
     *   details without taking over the account, such as through physical card theft, cloning, or
     *   online data breaches.
     * - `IDENTITY_THEFT`: Identity theft fraud occurs when a fraudster uses stolen personal

     *   loans, or conduct financial transactions in someone's name.
     * - `CARDHOLDER_MANIPULATION`: This type of fraud occurs when a fraudster manipulates or
