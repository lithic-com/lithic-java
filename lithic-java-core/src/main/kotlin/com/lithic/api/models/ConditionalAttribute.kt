/**
 * The attribute to target.
 *
 * The following attributes may be targeted:
 * - `MCC`: A four-digit number listed in ISO 18245. An MCC is used to classify a business by the
 *   types of goods or services it provides.
 * - `COUNTRY`: Country of entity of card acceptor. Possible values are: (1) all ISO 3166-1 alpha-3
 *   country codes, (2) QZZ for Kosovo, and (3) ANT for Netherlands Antilles.
 * - `CURRENCY`: 3-character alphabetic ISO 4217 code for the merchant currency of the transaction.
 * - `MERCHANT_ID`: Unique alphanumeric identifier for the payment card acceptor (merchant).
 * - `DESCRIPTOR`: Short description of card acceptor.
 * - `LIABILITY_SHIFT`: Indicates whether chargeback liability shift to the issuer applies to the
 *   transaction. Valid values are `NONE`, `3DS_AUTHENTICATED`, or `TOKEN_AUTHENTICATED`.
 * - `PAN_ENTRY_MODE`: The method by which the cardholder's primary account number (PAN) was
 *   entered. Valid values are `AUTO_ENTRY`, `BAR_CODE`, `CONTACTLESS`, `ECOMMERCE`, `ERROR_KEYED`,
 *   `ERROR_MAGNETIC_STRIPE`, `ICC`, `KEY_ENTERED`, `MAGNETIC_STRIPE`, `MANUAL`, `OCR`,
 *   `SECURE_CARDLESS`, `UNSPECIFIED`, `UNKNOWN`, `CREDENTIAL_ON_FILE`, or `ECOMMERCE`.
 * - `TRANSACTION_AMOUNT`: The base transaction amount (in cents) plus the acquirer fee field in the
 *   settlement/cardholder billing currency. This is the amount the issuer should authorize against
 *   unless the issuer is paying the acquirer fee on behalf of the cardholder.
 * - `RISK_SCORE`: Network-provided score assessing risk level associated with a given
 *   authorization. Scores are on a range of 0-999, with 0 representing the lowest risk and 999
 *   representing the highest risk. For Visa transactions, where the raw score has a range of 0-99,
 *   Lithic will normalize the score by multiplying the raw score by 10x.
 * - `CARD_TRANSACTION_COUNT_15M`: The number of transactions on the card in the trailing 15 minutes
 *   before the authorization.
 * - `CARD_TRANSACTION_COUNT_1H`: The number of transactions on the card in the trailing hour up and
 *   until the authorization.
 * - `CARD_TRANSACTION_COUNT_24H`: The number of transactions on the card in the trailing 24 hours
 *   up and until the authorization.
 * - `CARD_STATE`: The current state of the card associated with the transaction. Valid values are
 *   `CLOSED`, `OPEN`, `PAUSED`, `PENDING_ACTIVATION`, `PENDING_FULFILLMENT`.
 * - `PIN_ENTERED`: Indicates whether a PIN was entered during the transaction. Valid values are
 *   `TRUE`, `FALSE`.
 * - `PIN_STATUS`: The current state of card's PIN. Valid values are `NOT_SET`, `OK`, `BLOCKED`.
 * - `WALLET_TYPE`: For transactions using a digital wallet token, indicates the source of the
 *   token. Valid values are `APPLE_PAY`, `GOOGLE_PAY`, `SAMSUNG_PAY`, `MASTERPASS`, `MERCHANT`,
 *   `OTHER`, `NONE`.
